## Get Started


#### 1. Installation

On the command prompt run the following commands

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ritikarana/react-native-shopping.git

$ cd react-native-shopping/

$ npm install
```

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```
